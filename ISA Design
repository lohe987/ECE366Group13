ISA NAME=> ISANameProject2

Registers used=> 4
$r0 => Full general use and result storage
$r1 => Flexable
$r2 => Specalized addressing for advanced calcualtions
$r3 => Specalized addressing for advanced calcualtions

Memory=> 16 bit data with is taged to an integer
Each memory location starts at zero and increments by 1 each time. 
For both Code parts, the initalize memory is considered to start from zero.
There is 4 dedicated memory slots for the registers in memory that are unreachable from lw/sw instructions.

Instructions=>
init Rx imm
	MC: P|1 0|Rx I I I I
	*Note: Rx can only be $r0 and $r1 => address for imm to be stored
bez Rx
	MC: P|1 1|Rx X X X X
	*Note: Rx can only be $r0 and $r1 => jump distance; $r0 == 0 then the jump is done, otherwise ignore
add Rx Ry
	MC: P|0 0 0 0|Rx|Ry Ry
	*Note: Rx can only be $r0 and $r1; Ry = $r0, $r1, $r2, $r3; Sum is stored in Ry
slt Rx Ry
	MC: P|0 0 0 1|Rx|Ry Ry
	*Note: Rx can only be $r0 and $r1; Ry = $r0, $r1, $r2, $r3; puts value at Rx (Rx = Rx <? Ry)
lw Ry Rx
	MC: P|0 0 1 1|Ry Ry|Rx  
	*Note: Ry = $r0 or $r1 as destination; Rx can only be $r0 and $r1; Memory address is reached from the value stored in Rx register; X does not matter;
sw Ry Rx
	MC: P|0 0 1 0|Ry Ry|Rx
	*Note: Ry = $r0 or $r1's value stored; Memory address is reached from the value stored in Rx register;
XOR Rx Ry
	MC: P|0 1 0 0|Rx|Ry Ry
	*Note: Rx can only be $r0 and $r1; Ry = $r0, $r1, $r2, $r3; puts value at Rx (Rx = Rx XOR Ry)
AND Rx Ry
	MC: P|0 1 0 1|Rx|Ry Ry
	*Note: Rx can only be $r0 and $r1; Ry = $r0, $r1, $r2, $r3; puts value at Rx (Rx = Rx AND Ry)
srl Rx
	MC: P|0 1 1 1|Rx Rx X
	*Note: Barrel shifts right Rx; X does not matter
sub Ry Rx
	MC: P|0 1 1 0|Rx|Ry Ry
	*Note: Rx can only be $r0 and $r1; Ry = $r0, $r1, $r2, $r3; sub Ry - Rx is stored in Rx
